                Once your refund request is received and verified, we will notify you of the approval or rejection of your refund.
                If approved, your refund will be processed, and a credit will be applied to your original method of payment.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Processing Time: Refunds may take some time to be reflected in your account, depending on your payment provider. Please allow up to 7-10 business days for the refund to be processed and reflected in your account.</li>
                <li>
                    Late or Missing Refunds: If you haven't received a refund after the processing time has passed, please follow these steps:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Check your payment accounts again to ensure the refund was not missed.</li>
                        <li>Contact your credit card company or bank, as it may take additional time for the refund to be officially posted.</li>
