                At Matrix Solutions, we strive to provide our customers with the best experience possible. We understand that there may be instances where you may need to request a refund.
                Below is our detailed Refund Policy, which outlines the conditions under which refunds will be issued, and the procedures you should follow if you believe you are eligible for one.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section general-conditions">
            <h2>1. General Conditions</h2>
            <p>
                Refunds are only considered under specific circumstances. The following are the general conditions under which a refund may be issued:
            </p>
            <div class="content-sub-section company-details">
                <ul>
                    <li>Unauthorized Charges: If unauthorized charges have been made on your credit/debit card or any other payment method, and the order has not been delivered, you may be eligible for a refund.</li>
                    <li>Order Fulfillment Issues: If we are unable to fulfill your order due to a lack of stock or because the item is no longer available, we will process a refund.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section non-refundable-items">
            <h2>2. Non-Refundable Items</h2>
            <p>Certain products and services on our platform are non-refundable. These include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Game Top-Ups: Any game top-up that has been successfully credited to your account is considered final and non-refundable. Once the top-up is delivered, no refunds will be issued.</li>
                <li>Incorrect Login Credentials or Player IDs: If you provide incorrect login credentials or player IDs when making a purchase, and the order is delivered to those incorrect details, no refunds will be provided.</li>
                <li>Bonus Top-Ups: Bonus top-ups are managed and credited by the game authority, not Matrix Solutions. Therefore, we do not offer refunds if a bonus top-up is not credited to your account.</li>
                <li>Gift Cards and Digital Goods: We are not liable for any gift cards or other digital goods that have been stolen, misplaced, or misused without authorization. For the avoidance of doubt, Matrix Solutions is not obligated to inquire or verify at the redemption of the gift card if such a card has been properly obtained. All gift card and digital goods sales are final and non-refundable.</li>
                <li>CD Keys, Gift Cards, Game Points, Prepaid Cards: These products are non-refundable and non-exchangeable once purchased. Please ensure that you are purchasing the correct product before completing your transaction.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section refund-eligibility">
            <h2>3. Refund Eligibility</h2>
            <p>If your purchase meets any of the general conditions outlined above and is eligible for a refund, please follow the steps below to initiate the process:</p>

        <div class="content-section refund-processing">
            <h2>4. Refund Processing</h2>
            <p>
                Once your refund request is received and verified, we will notify you of the approval or rejection of your refund.
                If approved, your refund will be processed, and a credit will be applied to your original method of payment.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Processing Time: Refunds may take some time to be reflected in your account, depending on your payment provider. Please allow up to 7-10 business days for the refund to be processed and reflected in your account.</li>
                <li>
                    Late or Missing Refunds: If you haven't received a refund after the processing time has passed, please follow these steps:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Check your payment accounts again to ensure the refund was not missed.</li>
                        <li>Contact your credit card company or bank, as it may take additional time for the refund to be officially posted.</li>
                        <li>If you have followed these steps and still have not received your refund, contact us at <a href="mailto:matrixsolutionscs@gmail.com?subject=Refund%20Processing%20Inquiry">matrixsolutionscs@gmail.com</a> for further assistance.</li>
